## Learn to think through problems backwards as well as forward.

## Be reliable. Unreliability can cancel out the other virtues.

## Avoid intense ideologies. Always consider the other side as carefully as your own.

## Get rid of self-serving bias, envy, resentment, and self-pity. 

## At the same time, allow for the self-serving bias in others who haven't removed it.

## Avoid being part of a system with perverse incentives.

## Work with and under people you admire, and avoid the inverse when at all possible.

## Learn to maintain your objectivity, especially when it's hardest.

## Concentrate experience and power into the hands of the right people – the wise learning machines. 

## You'll be most successful where you're most intensely interested.

## Learn the all-important concept of assiduity: Sit down and do it until it's done.

## Use setbacks in life as an opportunity to become a bigger and better person. Don't wallow.

## The highest reach of civilization is a seamless system of trust among all parties concerned.
